# We rate dogs twitter data wrangling project
- This project seeked to analyse the we rate dogs dataset collected from twitter
- My conclusions were:
- The amount of retweets is related to the amount of likes
- The amount of retweets and likes increase over time
- Doggo and doggo pupper categories have the most likes
- Pupper category has the least amount of likes
